# simple-springboot-mysql-docker-swagger-app

This project is created for understanding how to set up Swagger 2 with Spring Boot REST API using Springfox implementation of the Swagger 2 specification.

In this project, I have created basic rest api endpoints Get, Post, Put and Delete with Spring boot.
I have used MySQL installed with docker, as the database.
